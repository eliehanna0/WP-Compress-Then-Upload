Compress & Upload images | Automatic Image Optimization

== Description ==

Compress & Upload lets you upload images to the WordPress media library but it first compresses and resizes them on your browser before uploading them.

This is particularly useful if you need to upload large sized images and you are using a poor internet connection or if your current WordPress site has small upload size limit.

* Install plugin
* Navigate to Media -> Compress & Upload
* Drag & Drop images into the dropzone and watch them get uploaded
* Navigate to Media -> Library to see your uploaded images
